# Tamagotchi-2025
Unit-1 project 1
    - A good icebox feature (optional feature) is to allow the creatures to ‘level’ up after a certain amount of interactions / time.
    - May include interaction animations or asset changes.

MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The goal: a fully playable, minimal version that demonstrates core functionality.

For the core gameplay, I want Stats to decrease over time and buttons to keep the pet alive. 

I want it to look visually appealing like a tamogotchin (soft, rounded) and the user to be able to choose the pets name. 

To push this further, i've made it so the pet "levels up" making it harder to keep it alive the longer you play. 

Warning messages when the pet is low on stats and a message for game over. 

Using template literals, the pet's name is used multiple times. In all messages and above the characters image. 

I consider this game now complete in it's current status. 

For the next steps on the game, the following will be implimented: 

Better image: Currently an image of a rat that was supposed to have a transparent background but doesn't.

Choice of pet: Choose from a drop down menu of multiple pets

Start with an egg: Level 0 will be just an egg that will hatch (currently starts level 1)

Better looking ui: Rounded buttons and nicer display.

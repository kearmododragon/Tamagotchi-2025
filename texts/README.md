# Tamagotchi-2025
Unit-1 project 1
    - A good icebox feature (optional feature) is to allow the creatures to ‘level’ up after a certain amount of interactions / time.
    - May include interaction animations or asset changes.

MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The goal: a fully playable, minimal version that demonstrates core functionality.

For the core gameplay, I want Stats to decrease over time and buttons to keep the pet alive. 

I want it to look visually appealing like a tamogotchin (soft, rounded) and the user to be able to choose the pets name. 

To push this further, i've made it so the pet "levels up" making it harder to keep it alive the longer you play. 

Warning messages when the pet is low on stats and a message for game over. 

Using template literals, the pet's name is used multiple times. In all messages and above the characters image. 

I've upgraded the images, rather than using block colour i've made use of free images for the game and background.

You can now choose your pet from a drop down list. Coded so I can add/remove animals with ease.

When you select your animal, you will start as an egg that will hatch at a random time (under 5 seconds) and only then the game starts

General ui upgrade to look cleaner

High score table updated
